Face Detection using OpenCV
This project demonstrates face detection using the OpenCV library in Python. It captures video from a webcam and detects faces in real-time using Haar Cascade classifiers.

Features
Real-time face detection: Detects faces in a live video stream using your webcam.
Multi-face detection: Supports detection of multiple faces simultaneously in one frame.
Prerequisites
Before running the program, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.6 or above)
OpenCV: The OpenCV Python library for image processing.
